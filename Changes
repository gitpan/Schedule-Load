**	This is a major release to add support for scheduling of
	multiple resources at the same time, and to add a prioritized
	list of waiters for each resource.

	Slreportd processes are forward and backward compatible.

***	Added Schedule::Load::Hold for information on who needs a host.

***	Added Schedule::Load::ResourceReq for scheduling multiple requests.

***	Schedule::Load::Schedule::hosts_of_class is depreciated.
	Equivelent is hosts_match(classes=>{....}, allow_reserved=>1)

***	Night hours is depreciated.  The default loading is now the
	full clump, if you wish to use a smaller percentage, make a local
	derrived class.  Likewise editing of the classes list to add
	_night suffixes is removed.  (This was never consistently applied.)

****	Socket reliability suggestions implemented.

* Schedule::Load 2.090 8/1/2002

**	Track local pids with fake reporter, unless track_hosts=0 specified.

***	Allow multiple colon separated hostnames with --dhost option.

***	Added ping() method for determining if a server is up.

***	Changed default of 6 cpus during day to be 20% of clump.
	This removes all "constant" numbers from the scheduler.

***	Added --hosts option to slrsh.

****	Fixed unreliable kill(0) to determine process death.

* Schedule::Load 1.8 3/18/2002

**	Added fake reporting hosts, for management of non-local hosts.

***	Added --parallel option to slrsh

***	Added additional host command options to slrsh

* Schedule::Load 1.7 12/11/2001

***	Greatly improved chooser reliability when processes talking to it
	CTRL-C or otherwise go bonkers.

* Schedule::Load 1.6 11/28/2001

**	Added slrsh command.  

**	Added Schedule::Host->idle_host_names and rschedule idle_host_names.

*** 	Fixed bug which would choose always choose a host with one lightly busy
	cpu over another with higher overall activity but free cpus.

* Schedule::Load 1.3 11/03/2000

**	The port number now comes from a lookup of slchoosed in /etc/services
	else uses 1752 if not found.
