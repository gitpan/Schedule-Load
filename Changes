****	Documentation updates.

* Schedule::Load 1.4 2000/11/30

	if the first server goes down.  When the first server comes back up, it
	will reset the backup server and take over processing.

***	Fixed bug which would choose always choose a host with one lightly busy
	cpu over another with higher overall activity but free cpus.

* Schedule::Load 1.3 2000/11/03

**	The port number now comes from a lookup of slchoosed in /etc/services
	else uses 1752 if not found.

****	Fixed Linux bug causing high CPU usage (blocking read didn't block).

* Schedule::Load 1.2 2000/01/21

****	test.pl improvements: check for free port, use test store directory.

* Schedule::Load 1.1 2000/01/17
