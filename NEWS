***	Slrsh now requires a "e"xit instead of a ctrl-C to exit.

***	Added rschedule --similar option for selecting hosts.

	This is useful for derating Intel processors vs. AMD processors.

* Changes in Schedule::Load 3.010 3/10/2004

* Changes in Schedule::Load 3.003 1/27/2004

**	This is a major release to add support for scheduling of
	multiple resources at the same time, and to add a prioritized
	list of waiters for each resource.

	Slreportd processes are forward and backward compatible.

***	Added Schedule::Load::Hold for information on who needs a host.

***	Added Schedule::Load::ResourceReq for scheduling multiple requests.

***	Added rschedule holds command.

***	Added pid tracking of fixed_loads on fake reporters.

**	Several interface items have been cleaned up.

***	Schedule::Load::Schedule::hosts_of_class is depreciated.
	Equivelent is hosts_match(classes=>{....}, allow_reserved=>1)

***	Night hours is depreciated.  The default loading is now the
	full clump, if you wish to use a smaller percentage, make a local
	derrived class.  Likewise editing of the classes list to add
	_night suffixes is removed.  (This was never consistently applied.)

	cpu over another with higher overall activity but free cpus.
