* Changes in Schedule::Load 1.4 11/30/2000

**	Added --dhost option to slchoosed
	Specifing multiple slchoosed hostnames now provides a backup server
	if the first server goes down.  When the first server comes back up, it
	will reset the backup server and take over processing.

*** 	Fixed bug which would choose always choose a host with one lightly busy
	cpu over another with higher overall activity but free cpus.


* Changes in Schedule::Load 1.3 11/03/2000

**	The port number now comes from a lookup of slchoosed in /etc/services
	else uses 1752 if not found.

****	Fixed Linux bug causing high CPU usage (blocking read didn't block).


* Changes in Schedule::Load 1.2 1/21/2000

****	test.pl improvements: check for free port, use test store directory.
