@section Description

This package allows accessing loading and top job status across many
machines on a network, comprising a server farm.  It also allows for
scheduling new jobs on the best machine across the entire network.

For example:

@example
  rtop

HOST         CPUs FREQ TotCPU%  LOAD  RATE RL ARCH/OS
alpha           8  400   27.9%     2 17.12    sun4-solaris 2.6
omega           1  333    0.2%     1   inf R1 Reserved: qzurns at 17-Jan 10:29
beta            6  248   69.4%     5 19.46    sun4-solaris 2.6

HOST            PID USER     NICE    MEM STATE  RUNTM   CPU% COMMAND
beta           4678 qmullens    0    34M cpu1    3:04  12.4% vt urx/urx_cell_ms
alpha          4047 charlieg   19   147M cpu9   16:44  12.4% dc_shell ccr_iorg

  rschedule best
Best host is 'alpha'

@end example

Perl functions provide object oriented access to all of this information
and more.

Also included is a program to warn of jobs with over two hours of CPU
time, renice them to 19 and send mail to the offending user.

See @samp{man Schedule::Load} after installation.
