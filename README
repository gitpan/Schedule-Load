1.2 Description
===============

This package allows accessing loading and top job status across many
machines on a network, comprising a server farm.  It also allows for
scheduling new jobs on the best machine across the entire network.

   For example:

       rtop

     HOST         CPUs FREQ TotCPU%  LOAD  RATE RL ARCH/OS
     alpha           8  400   27.9%     2 17.12    sun4-solaris 2.6
     omega           1  333    0.2%     1   inf R1 Reserved: qzurns at 17-Jan 10:29
     beta            6  248   69.4%     5 19.46    sun4-solaris 2.6

     HOST            PID USER     NICE    MEM STATE  RUNTM   CPU% COMMAND
     beta           4678 qmullens    0    34M cpu1    3:04  12.4% vt urx/urx_cell_ms
     alpha          4047 charlieg   19   147M cpu9   16:44  12.4% dc_shell ccr_iorg

       rschedule best
     Best host is 'alpha'

   Perl functions provide object oriented access to all of this
information and more.

   Also included is a program to warn of jobs with over two hours of CPU
time, renice them to 19 and send mail to the offending user.

   See `man Schedule::Load' after installation.
